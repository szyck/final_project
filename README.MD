<h1>Module 20  segment 1: Mobile-Price-Classification-kaggle</h1>

This project has been implementing using python library like Numpy,Pandas to importing the data and design the data and also using Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization for data.

A dataset consisting of various parameters to predict the price score/range of a mobile phone based on certain inputs such as following:

id:ID
battery_power:Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh
blue:Has bluetooth or not
clock_speed:speed at which microprocessor executes instructions
dual_sim:Has dual sim support or not
fc:Front Camera mega pixels
four_g:Has 4G or not
int_memory:Internal Memory in Gigabytes
m_dep:Mobile Depth in cm
mobile_wt:Weight of mobile phone
n_cores:Number of cores of processor
pc:Primary Camera mega pixels
px_height:Pixel Resolution Height
px_width:Pixel Resolution Width
ram:Random Access Memory in Megabytes
sc_h:Screen Height of mobile in cm
sc_w:Screen Width of mobile in cm
talk_time:longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are
three_g:Has 3G or not
touch_screen:Has touch screen or not
wifi:Has wifi or not

<h2>analysis</h2>

We studied the entire dataset we had for the topic on Kaggle found all the important information on the data we were going to work on
* The Data Preprocessing
* Description of Data
* Info about the data
* The Correlation between the attributes
* The attributes that are most correlated with the Price Range ( Our target )
* Outlier Analysis of Non-categorical Data
* Histogram of all the attributes
The idea of implementing svm classifier in Python is to use the phone specification features to train an SVM classifier and use the trained SVM model to predict the price_range.

Next we tried a total of 9 Machine Learning Algorithms for each we made a confusion matrix and the most contributing features were found:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree(gini)
* Decision Tree(entropy)
* Random Forest
* Naive Bayes
* SVM

We compared the accuracies of all the models and found that SVM is the best classifier for our project
